The dendrite trunk has been intersected at an angle by the plane of polishing to give the observed morphology. Between the dendrites is the Al - CuAl2 eutectic. Initially dendrites would have formed from the liquid, the regions between the dendrite arms known as the mushy zone transforming to a eutectic solid (L to Al + CuAl2). These two phases form cooperatively as neighbouring lamellae with the lateral diffusion of material across the growing interface. The relative amounts of the two phases (Al and CuAl2 ) within the eutectic are determined by applying the Lever Rule at the eutectic temperature.",Prof T W Clyne,"Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge",https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrographs/large/000001.jpg,./miclib_output/images/000001.jpg,https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrograph_record.php?id=1

From the melt a eutectic is formed between aluminium solid solution and virtually pure silicon. Slow solidification produces a very coarse microstructure. The eutectic comprises large plates of silicon in the aluminium matrix. This microstructure displays poor ductility due to the brittleness of large silicon plates. The microstructure is normally refined through either rapid solidification, which lets the silicon phase assume a fibrous form, or by a process known as modification.

It may be noted that primary aluminium dendrites can be seen, although the composition is very close to the eutectic point and an entirely eutectic microstructure might thus have been expected. This effect is a consequence of the strongly skewed nature of the eutectic ""coupled zone"" in the Al-Si system. The coupled zone represents the combinations of melt composition and interfacial undercooling (or growth velocity) for which (coupled) eutectic growth can occur. It can be plotted on the phase diagram by extending the two liquidus lines below the eutectic temperature.

From the melt a eutectic is formed between aluminium solid solution and virtually pure silicon. Slow solidification produces a very coarse microstructure. The eutectic comprises large plates of silicon in the aluminium matrix. This microstructure displays poor ductility due to the brittleness of large silicon plates. The microstructure is normally refined through either rapid solidification, which lets the silicon phase assume a fibrous form, or by a process known as modification.

It may be noted that primary aluminium dendrites can be seen, although the composition is very close to the eutectic point and an entirely eutectic microstructure might thus have been expected. This effect is a consequence of the strongly skewed nature of the eutectic ""coupled zone"" in the Al-Si system. The coupled zone represents the combinations of melt composition and interfacial undercooling (or growth velocity) for which (coupled) eutectic growth can occur. It can be plotted on the phase diagram by extending the two liquidus lines below the eutectic temperature. The Si liquidus line curves sharply back towards higher Si contents as the undercooling is increased. (This is associated with the facetted growth mode of the Si phase.)

It is placed in the casting mould which is preheated to 1000 Â°C and the Nimonic poured in at 1600 Â°C. On cooling it is etched away with caustic soda.,Cores for investment cast Nimonic turbine blades for jet engines providing the cooling path.,Polished but unetched.,Reflected light microscopy,300 μm,The milling makes the (light contrast) silica particles angular leaving only a few contact points between them. This sample still contains the polymeric resin. The low thermal expansion of fused silica and subsequent good thermal shock resistance make it ideal for this application.,Prof W E Lee,"Department of Engineering Materials, University of Sheffield",https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrographs/large/000155.gif,./miclib_output/images/000155.jpg,https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrograph_record.php?id=155

The Barker's etch produces a thick oxide layer on the grains of aluminium (anodising). When viewed in cross-polarised light, interference in the oxide layer produces colours which depend on grain orientation, hence the grain structure is imaged. Strain of the aluminium matrix during rolling around the intermetallic particles in the Al-Fe-Mn alloy produces a high density of dislocations.

At the eutectic point the remaining carbon-enriched austenite transforms to pearlite (a mixture of ferrite and cementite), which is the darker region of the micrograph. The proportion of pearlite is dependent upon the overall composition.

Subsequent to casting the sample was annealed for a long period just below the transformation range. This induces the cementite to take on a spherical appearance. This results in a softer and more ductile alloy. This process is known as spheroidisation.

This can be achieved by treating them with acid to oxidise the tube surfaces. The tubes will then spontaneously disperse in an aqueous medium. The viscosity of these suspensions is analogous to that of polymers; it increases gradually with concentration up to a critical point (at about 0.7 vol%) where entanglement occurs. However, their separation is determined more by surface repulsions than by entropy arising from chain flexibility. Their stiffness suggests that parallel clusters might be a natural state for aggregation but it also means that any deviations form straightness of the tubes (due to defects) will compromise significant tube parallelism.

In the region of the tear, however, the colours indicate strain-induced orientation: because the material is above the glass transition temperature of PE (-30 deg C) chain sliding occurs readily under and applied stress and the molecules become aligned along the tensile axis.

Its velocity is initially so great that no interfacial breakdown is possible.

This results in a 'columnar zone' which may extend to the centre of the casting but often gives way to an 'equiaxed zone'. The equiaxed grains may result from sedimentation from the free surface, from the detachment of dendrite tips, or simply from heterogeneous nucleation ahead of the advancing front (though the latter is only likely if deliberate 'melt inoculation' has been implemented).",Prof T W Clyne,"Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge",https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrographs/large/000615.jpg,./miclib_output/images/000615.jpg,https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrograph_record.php?id=615

Hardening is achieved by the controlled rejection of copper from a supersaturated solid solution. There is some additional hardening from precipitates such as MgSi2. From the phase diagram for the pure aluminium-copper binary system, it can be seen that the solubility of copper in -aluminium increases with increasing temperature up to the eutectic temperature of about 550Â°C. The equilibrium microstructure below the eutectic temperature is a two-phase mixture of -aluminium and the Al2Cu intermetallic phase (also known as q phase). The initial solution heat treatment aims to obtain the maximum possible concentration of copper in solution. Rapid quenching from the solution temperature prevents the kinetically slow precipitation of , forming a highly supersaturated solid solution of copper.

Rapid quenching also preserves the large number density of vacancies in the aluminium lattice from the high solution temperature. This increases copper diffusion rates at low temperature and accelerates ageing. Care must be taken with commercial alloys where the additional alloying elements reduce the eutectic temperature. This reduces the maximum solution heat treatment temperature since heating above the eutectic temperature causes the growth of a brittle intergranular eutectic.

Ageing may occur at room temperature (Natural Ageing) or above (Artificial Ageing), and takes place via a sequence of precipitation reactions. At low temperatures, the sequence may not be completed even after very long times, whereas at high temperatures, where diffusion is rapid, the early stages may not be observed.

The microstructure in this sample shows q phase at high magnification.

The domain pattern was obtained by sectioning a bulk ceramic specimen with a diamond saw, followed by polishing and chemical etching to reveal the domain structure. In this case, the herringbone type domain structure represents the frozen in domain configuration of a grain within the ceramic.

The alloy has a number of distinct phases present in its microstructure. These are namely the matrix, g, and the precipitates, g', g'', and d.

The primary strengthening phase is g'' [1], the composition of which is Ni3Nb. It has a body-centred tetragonal structure, and forms semi-coherently as disc-shaped platelets within the g matrix, having three variants lying on the {100} planes. It is stable for over 10,000 hours at 600°C; however, above this temperature it decomposes to form g', Ni3Al (between 650°C and 850Â°C), and d, the same composition as g'' (between 750°C and 1000°C). It has been commented that, at large volume fractions and when it forms continuously along grain boundaries, d is detrimental to both strength and toughness [2].

The d phase that forms is more stable than the g'' phase, and has an orthorhombic structure. During cooling, d phase precipitates begin to form along the {111} planes in the matrix, nucleating at grain boundaries at approximately 1010°C.

The g' precipitates, of L12 structure, are seen within the g matrix when it has been depleted of niobium due to the formation of g'' and d.

The Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram for IN718 shows that d precipitates at higher temperatures than the g'', and that over long periods of time both d and g' are more stable than g''.

The micrograph shows the microstructure after being held for 1 minute at 850°C, demonstrating that no precipitation has occurred.

The alloy has a number of distinct phases present in its microstructure. These are namely the matrix, g, and the precipitates, g', g'', and d.

The primary strengthening phase is g'' [1], the composition of which is Ni3Nb. It has a body-centred tetragonal structure, and forms semi-coherently as disc-shaped platelets within the g matrix, having three variants lying on the {100} planes. It is stable for over 10,000 hours at 600°C; however, above this temperature it decomposes to form g', Ni3Al (between 650°C and 850°C), and d, the same composition as g'' (between 750°C and 1000°C). It has been commented that, at large volume fractions and when it forms continuously along grain boundaries, d is detrimental to both strength and toughness [2].

The d phase that forms is more stable than the g'' phase, and has an orthorhombic structure. During cooling, d phase precipitates begin to form along the {111} planes in the matrix, nucleating at grain boundaries at approximately 1010°C.

The g' precipitates, of L12 structure, are seen within the g matrix when it has been depleted of niobium due to the formation of g'' and d.

The Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram for IN718 shows that d precipitates at higher temperatures than the g'', and that over long periods of time both d and g' are more stable than g''.

The micrograph shows the microstructure after being held for 24 hours at 850°C, here, the highest volume fraction of d has formed.

Etched first with 4% Picral and then with 10% aqueous sodium metabisulfite (SMB) solution.,Reflected light microscopy,6 μm,Dual phase steel annealed at 750°C for 5mins and then water quenched to room temperature. The microstructures revealed that the carbides are not dissolved at this low intercritical temperature and some undissolved pearlite lamallae can still be observed. Austenite is visible at grain boundaries and the martensite has been tinted by the application of second tint-etch. Martensite appears straw-coloured. Some M-A constituents can be clearly seen by the application of this step-etching technique.,Dr Amar K De,"ASPPRC, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department, Colorado School of Mines",https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrographs/large/000735.jpg,./miclib_output/images/000735.jpg,https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/micrograph_record.php?id=735

The sample was cold-deformed by rolling and then annealed at 704Â°C for one hour. The image shows a beautiful picture of annealing twins. Notice how the ends of annealing twins are flat, the shape being determined by a minimisation of interfacial energy. Mechanical twins, by contrast, are lenticular (lens like) with sharply pointed ends to minimise the strain energy due to the twinning shear. Annealing twins do not cause any deformation so strain energy minimisation is not an issue. This is also the reason why there is no strain field contrast visible at the tips of the annealing twins.
